        <h1>My dream job</h1>
    </header>
    <p>I have a couple of different dream jobs. My dream for many years was as many other to become a pro fotballer og athlet in different sports. As many people figuret out it was not as simple as i hoped for. I was training far more then my body could handle and mentaly i did not have what it takes to live this drem. For many years now i have dremt of becoming a diver and this is something i relly want to do, at the moment im freediving and working up to take my diving licence.
        <br> Right now since im studying to become a programer i dream of working for a big company or independently owning my own one day. I have always wanted to have my own company and hopfully have it be succesfull.  </p>
